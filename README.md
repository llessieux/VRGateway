"# VRGateway" 

VRGateway.

A simple framework for displaying various applications in HTC Vive using the OpenVR framework.

Test applications (Selection with command line only for now):

* Taiko VR (-taiko_vr on the command line). Expects a custom version of the PPSSPP emulator running Taiko no Tatsujin.
Will display the game on a virtual screen and display a drum with sticks replacing the PSP controls.

* VLC VR: (-vlc_vr with optional -vlc_stereo_vr option)
Display the screen of VLC in VR.
With the stereo option it will show a side by side 3D Movie in 3D in VR :)
